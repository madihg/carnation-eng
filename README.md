## About

This interface was built with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and [fine-tuned](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates) on contemporary French poetry. The model draws from classical French poets like Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and Hugo, as well as modern voices including Prix Goncourt and Prix Apollinaire winners.
